        title: "Breathe When You Stretch",
        description: "It’s common to hold your breath (usually without even realizing it) when you’re in a stretch. Instead, try to use this time—pre- or post-exercise—to inhale and exhale mindfully. This will help you move deeper into the stretch, allowing your muscles to relax more fully.And when stretching as part of your cool-down, mindful breath work will help bring your heart rate back to normal. These few minutes you spend extending and breathing intentionally can also serve as a mental transition into or out of a workout, preparing you for the session ahead or allowing you to reflect on your efforts.",

        description: "food is a valuable energy source that will fuel your workouts and help you recover from them. As such, aim to eat a light protein and carb based meal within a few hours before AND after exercising. Make sure that this still fits into your daily food intake so that you don’t end up ingesting extra food than usual (unless your goal is to gain weight).",
